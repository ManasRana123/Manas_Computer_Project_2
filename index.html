                We are making this decision because we believe it is a step to help protect our teams and our customers. We are using this time to improve everything we do.<br>
                1. We are going to renovate our stores and make them look great again.<br>
                2. We are going to improve every product and make our food the best in town again.<br>
                3. We are under new management and we are going to start getting better every day. That we promise.<br>
                The next few weeks are going to be tough. Might as well eat some awesome food!<br>
